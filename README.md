# GeyserClient
Python clients for geyser M2M system. (DSL and MODEM)

These two programs will eventually be used to drive the measurement hardware connected to the geyser. 
Python (as opposed to Java) is used since it is very easy to do GPIO tasks.

The Java version of these two programms will only be used as a simulator.
